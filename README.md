# Applied Data Science Capstone

This repository contains the final project and supporting materials for IBM's Applied Data Science Course, part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

## Project Overview

The Applied Data Science Capstone is a culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. This project involves working with a real-world dataset to demonstrate proficiency in various data science and machine learning techniques.

## Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Collecting data from various sources using APIs, web scraping, or open datasets.
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualization and statistical analysis.
- **Model Development**: Building machine learning models to make predictions based on the data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models and refining them for better accuracy.
- **Reporting**: Presenting the findings and insights to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following main sections:

- **1. Data Collection and Wrangling**: Scripts and notebooks related to data acquisition and preprocessing.
- **2. Exploratory Data Analysis**: Notebooks containing visualizations and insights derived from the data.
- **3. Model Development**: Machine learning models built using various techniques, such as support vector machines, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors.
- **4. Model Evaluation**: Analysis of model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
- **5. Final Report**: A comprehensive report summarizing the entire project, including the methodology, results, and recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and model building.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Beautiful Soup**: For web scraping and extracting data from HTML and XML files.
- **SpaceX REST API**: For accessing and retrieving data related to SpaceX launches and other information.
- **SQLite**: For managing and querying the dataset using a lightweight, relational database management system.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to APIs and retrieving data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing and presenting the analysis and findings.
- **PowerPoint**: For creating and presenting a slide deck summarizing the project's key points.
